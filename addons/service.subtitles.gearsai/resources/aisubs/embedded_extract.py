# Ported into GearsAI 2026-07-20 from Kodi-POV-IL's service.subtitles.kodipovilai
# (0.2.406) embedded_extract.py -- stdlib-only, self-contained by design, taken
# verbatim (it has no addon-specific code; callers pass log/abort callbacks).
# It is the read-the-TEXT counterpart to OUR mkv_probe.py (timestamps only).

# Embedded-subtitle TEXT extractor for the AI translation pipeline.
#
# Reads the *text* of an embedded subtitle track (SRT / ASS-SSA / WebVTT)
# straight out of a playing MKV/WebM -- over local files or debrid HTTP Range
# requests -- so the AI pipeline can translate a PERFECTLY SYNCED source: the
# embedded track's cue timestamps ARE the video's own timeline, so the Hebrew
# it produces needs no re-sync at all.
#
# This is the read-the-TEXT counterpart to mkv_probe.py, which reads only the
# embedded track's TIMESTAMPS (to re-time an external sub). Both walk the same
# Matroska structures; this one additionally reads the block PAYLOAD and, for
# HTTP, uses the Cues index to fetch only the clusters that hold subtitle data.
#
# Strategy:
#   local file  -> one sequential pass over the clusters (cheap, complete).
#   HTTP/debrid -> parse Cues, visit only the referenced clusters via surgical
#                  Range requests (tens of MB, never the whole file); if the
#                  file has no usable Cues we bail to None (the caller then
#                  falls through to the existing external-subtitle path).
#
# Self-contained: stdlib only, no xbmc, no package imports -- so it ships in
# BOTH the build and the slim standalone edition. Every entry point is fully
# guarded and returns None / [] on any problem, so a caller ALWAYS has the
# existing external path to fall back to: this can only ADD a source, never
# break one. Only TEXT codecs are extracted (S_TEXT/*); bitmap tracks
# (PGS/VOBSUB) are reported by probe_tracks() but not extracted here.
